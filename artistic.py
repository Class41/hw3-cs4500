# Purpose #

This application creates works of art by dropping "paint blobs" across a given
grid size. Paintings are complete only when all squares on the aforementioned
grid are filled with at least one blob. This proccesses is repeated a specified
number of times

# Requirements #

1. On the screen, ask the interactive user to enter an integer between 2 and 15
   inclusive. This will determine the size of your square grid. I will call this
   number N. If the user enters something illegal, give an error message and
   keep asking until you get something appropriate.
2. Next, ask the interactive user to enter an integer between 1 and 10
   inclusive. This will tell your program how many “paintings” it will make. I
   will call this number K. If the user enters something illegal, give an error
   message and keep asking until you get something appropriate.
3. Make an N X N random paint blob painting K times. As each of the K paintings
   is being made, display graphics on the screen to show the interactive user
   how the painting is proceeding. You have great latitude as to how you will
   display the painting as it fills up with paint. At the very least, the
   interactive user should be able to tell which cells have NO paint so far,
   which cells have SOME paint so far, and which cell is being painted right at
   the moment. This minimum would require three distinct colors. However, you
   might be able to think of a clever way to visually communicate more
   information about the painting than no paint, some paint, and currently being
   painted. Be thoughtful and creative about this, please. Give some thought as
   to how quickly you want to paint drops to appear in your simulation.
4. After a painting “finishes,” alert the interactive user, and inform them that
   they must push ENTER (or RETURN) to continue.
5. After all K paintings have been finished (including the final ENTER push by
   the user), display the following statistics from all the paintings: The
   minimum, maximum, and average number of paint blobs it took to paint a
   picture; and the minimum, maximum, and average number that describes the most
   paint blobs that fell into any one cell in a painting. 

# Operation specific description #

When program starts, the user is asked what their grid size preference is, after
a value is entered (N) and ENTER is pressed, the user will be asked how many of
these paintings they would like the program to complete (K). After a number is
entered and ENTER is pressed, a GUI will appear and a grid of size N x N will be
drawn. If a grid cell has no paint in it, it will be highlighted with a
light-gray outline, if a cell has paint, it will have no border. If a cell is
currently being painted into, it will get a hot-pink outline which is then
removed on the next cycle. The proccess of placing ink blobs on the N x N grid
continues until the painting is complete--that is when no gray cells exist/all
cells have a paint blob. At which point, the user can admire the painting and
press ENTER or RETURN to continue onto the next artwork repeating the cycle K
many times. Afterwards, displays the overall statistics for the paintings.
